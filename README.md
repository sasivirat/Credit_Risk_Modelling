## **Background**
Credit risk modeling is crucial for financial institutions. It represents the risk of a borrower not being able to pay back loans or credit card balances. Borrowers may only partially repay amounts, impacting both principal and interest. Machine learning and statistical modeling are essential for managing big data and conducting robust analyses.

## **Project**
This AI-powered project models credit risk in compliance with Basel accords.  

**Objectives:**  
- Build a credit risk model using loan data.  
- Provide a scorecard for daily evaluation and calculate exposure loss.

### **Steps:**
1. Preprocessing â€” Convert columns into dummy variables using fine and coarse classing  
2. Develop PD Model using Logistic Regression  
3. Deliver scorecard in CSV format based on PD model  
4. Construct LGD model with Beta Regression  
5. Build EAD model with Linear Regression  
6. Calculate Exposure Loss (EL) after obtaining all models  
7. Validate models using the Population Stability Index
